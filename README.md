# twitter-post

A very simple example to post a Twitter status (tweet) using Twitter API and Tweepy.
- Post with media (image, or video)
- Include embedded link (URL)

Prior to use the Python code:
- Get Twitter API Credentials from https://developer.twitter.com.
- Ensure you have an 'Elevated Access', so that you can both Read and Write permissions. 
- Install tweepy using: pip tweepy
